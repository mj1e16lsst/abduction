# abduction
===========

This project is a collection of implementations of the possible world explorer (PWE). For tutorials on PWE usage, see https://github.com/idaks/PW-explorer. Each implementation starts with a dataset and then applies the following procedure:
 - transcribe the dataset to a datalog fact database;
 - create the allowed transformations in datalog;
 - combine the dataset and transformations and solve using clingo via PWE; 
 - create a DiGraph from the clingo output;
 - extract the relevant statistics from the graph. 
 
# Datasets
----------

 The following datasets were evaluated using the above procedue:
  - toyDataSet, a simple relational database contructed using values from ([1]). Allowed transformations were SQL SELECT, PROJECT, and UPDATE commands.
  - qfix, a relational database example from [2]. Allowed transformations were SQL SELECT, PROJECT, and UPDATE commands.
  - flights, a database of flight logs from https://figshare.com/articles/flights_csv/9820139/1. Allowed transformations are airport-to-airport flight rountes
